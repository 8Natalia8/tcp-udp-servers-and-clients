# tcp-udp-servers-and-clients
Here are two clients (tcp for linux and udp for windows) and two servers (tcp fow windows and udp for linux). Two text files are also present - input files for clients, you should rename them to sample.txt if you would decide to test it; three out of four emulators on Ruby lang are here, the fourth will be loaded when I found it on my computer :)
